# Making a biophysical model for Crassostrea gigas

Currently planning to make a biophysical temperature model for the pacific oyster as part of a grant with Steven Roberts and Emily Carrington developing stress priming protocols for juvenile oysters. Ideally, this model will provide information on what stocking densities and culture methods are best for keeping oysters cool in the summer and therefore less susceptible to OsHV-1.
